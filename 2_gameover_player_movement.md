Step-by-Step Plan
1. Design a Game Over UI Panel
In Unity, go to your Canvas → Create UI → Panel.

Name it: GameOverPanel

Add a Text (UI → Text or TextMeshPro) to say "Game Over"

Style it how you like.

Uncheck the GameOverPanel in the Inspector so it’s invisible at the start.

2. Add a Collider and Tag to the Mushroom
Add a 2D Collider to the "mushroom" (e.g., BoxCollider2D)

Check Is Trigger (so it doesn’t block the player).

Tag the mushroom as "Obstacle" (create this tag if needed in the Tag dropdown).

3. Modify Your PlayerController Script
Add a public GameObject gameOverPanel; reference and a trigger detection method.

Final Setup
Drag your GameOverPanel into the PlayerController script field in the Inspector.

Make sure your "mushroom" is tagged "Obstacle" and has a 2D trigger collider.

That’s it! Your game will now pause and display “Game Over” when the player touches the mushroom.
